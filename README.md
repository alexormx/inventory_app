# ðŸ“Œ **Rails Inventory WebApp Progress Update**

## ðŸš€ **Project Overview**
This document provides an updated progress report on the Rails Inventory WebApp, including completed tasks, current state, and next steps. The project is being developed using Rails 8.0.1, Ruby 3.2.2, and PostgreSQL, with Devise for authentication and Bootstrap for styling. The development follows an agile approach, with tasks broken down into sprints.

## ðŸ“Œ **Current State**

### **Core Framework & Setup**
- **Rails Version:** 8.0.1
- **Ruby Version:** 3.2.2

### **Task 1.3: Choose & Set Up CSS Framework**
- **Status:** In Progress
- **Next Steps:**

### **Task 1.5: Push Changes to GitHub & Deploy to Heroku**
- **Status:** Not Started
- **Next Steps:**
  - Push the `feature/admin-dashboard` branch to GitHub.
  - Merge to `main` via Pull Request.
  - Deploy to Heroku:
    ```bash
