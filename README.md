## 🚀 **Next step we will start with Sprint 2**
Let's proceed with **Sprint 2: Admin Product Management**. If you have any questions or need further adjustments, please let me know! 🚀

## 🚀 SEO Improvements
- Meta tags for description, canonical URL, and Open Graph have been added to layouts.
- `sitemap_generator` gem generates `sitemap.xml.gz`; run `rake sitemap:generate`.
- `robots.txt` references the sitemap to help search engines crawl the site.

## 🍪 Cookie Banner Configuration
The cookie banner text and button label can be customized, or the banner can be disabled entirely, using environment variables:

- `COOKIE_BANNER_ENABLED` – set to `false` to hide the banner (default: `true`).
- `COOKIE_BANNER_TEXT` – message displayed to users (default shown in Spanish).
- `COOKIE_BANNER_BUTTON_TEXT` – label for the acceptance button (default: `Aceptar`).

These variables allow tailoring the cookie notice to local regulations without changing application code.
